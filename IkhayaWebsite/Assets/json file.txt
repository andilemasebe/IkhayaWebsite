The appsettings.json is used in .NET and .NET Core applications to read and get a value from the configuration file using the JSON format.

Creating an ASP.NET Core C# project using the template creates the appsettings.json and creates the functionality to read it in the application. 

This replaces the ConfigurationManager and web.config file that was used in .NET Framework projects.

We'll show you the differences between web.config and appsettings.json. 

In particular, we'll highlight the benefits of using appsettings.json for settings, such as being able to group similar values into a section. We'll also show you how to store settings with different object types, such as an integer, or a boolean.

From there, it can be used with IConfiguration in an ASP.NET Core web app to get a value, or to get a section. We'll show you how to read a value from appsettings.json, and render it through an ASP.NET Core web app.
